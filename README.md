# Hi 👋 My name is Flavio Del Grosso  
## Senior Software Engineer

---

As a web developer and JavaScript engineer, I am deeply passionate about creating engaging and intuitive digital experiences aligned with modern industry trends. My commitment to continuous learning allows me to stay up to date with emerging technologies.

I succeed in environments that value collaboration and inclusivity, where I can actively contribute to a healthy and stimulating work culture. I constantly seek opportunities to collaborate with inspiring individuals, sharing knowledge and supporting colleagues to achieve common goals. My aspiration is to be part of quality-oriented teams, where each member is motivated to elevate standards and pursue exceptional results through a collaborative approach.

A key professional goal of mine is to increase my engagement in open source projects, as I genuinely love the fulfillment that comes from contributing to collectively shared resources.

Beyond my experience in the tech industry, my background as a professional classical pianist and music educator deeply influences my approach to problem-solving and design, blending technical precision with artistic sensitivity.

I particularly resonate with Albert Einstein’s words:  
> "I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music."

This philosophy inspires both my work and my life, integrating structure and creativity into everything I do.
